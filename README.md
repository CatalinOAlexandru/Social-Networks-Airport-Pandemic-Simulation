# Social-Networks-Airport-Pandemic-Simulation

As we have seen in relation to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) the easiest way for an epidemic to eventually escalate into a pandemic is if asymptomatic patients travel to another country via air transportation and spread the disease to other people in another country. In the context of this project, we questioned whether it was possible or not to reduce the rate of the spread of the coronavirus by closing airports when they become infected and also gradually closing airports when a certain percentage of their neighbours are infected.
